if we want to define what action should be performed on given resourse ( like data in server) we use http methods 

so there are five http methods 
GET 
POST
PUT
PATCH 
DELETE

GET 
For getting the data from server 
example Searching on Browser

for sending or mutate some data in server 
example filling sign up form

PUT 
for uploading file/image we use PUT 
example uploading resume 

PATCH 
if we want to change/update the data in server use patch 

DELETE 
if we want to delete a particular data from server use DELETE
