So in Statefull autentication 

- user logins 
- server create session and stores 
- send response of session as session ID / cookies / headers
- client while requesting everything it sends cookies/ Session ID for autentication to server , so that server can recognize client 

Disadvantage of Statefull autentication 

- Whenever Server is restarted, its state are lost and all user get logged out 
- it takes server memory to store session ID 

to overcome this we use Stateless autentication (JWT)
