So versioning is imp in terms of security 

so express.js version is ^5.1.0

so First part -> 5
   Second part -> 1
   Third part -> 0

Third part = Minor change -> optional to download 
Second part = Recommended Bug changes 
Third part = Major / breaking update -> previous version might not work

^ -> using this we can suggest user -> ^5 == 5.1.0 to 6.0.0 is safe and use to ,after 6.0.0 the things might get changes
